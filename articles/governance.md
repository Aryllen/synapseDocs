# Synapse Commons Governance Overview

Synapse operates under a complete governance process that includes well-documented Terms and Conditions of Use, 
guidelines and operating procedures, privacy enhancing technologies, as well as the right of audit and external reviews.

### [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SageBionetworksSynapseTermsandConditionsofUse.pdf?v=4){:target="_blank"}

The Terms and Conditions of Use document is a detailed description of the terms by which Synapse users must operate. 
It establishes the use, disclaimers and limitation of liability governing the use of Synapse including the requirement to adhere 
to all laws and regulations to protect the privacy of participants whose data they use.

### [Data Use Procedure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SynapseCommonsDataUseProcedure.pdf?v=4){:target="_blank"}

Robust procedures support data contribution and use through a Tiered system that distinguishes Open or Controlled data use based 
on the nature of the data and the conditions delineated by the data contributor. We recommend that data stored in Synapse be 
de-identified according to HIPAA standards. Synapse users must register before using controlled content on Synapse. 
In some cases they must also show proof of approval of their data analysis plan from an ethics committee or institutional 
review board prior to accessing the data through Synapse.

### [Privacy Policy](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SynapsePrivacyPolicy.pdf?v=4){:target="_blank"}

The Privacy Policy explains how Sage Bionetworks aims to protect personal information received in connection with Synapse 
from casual visitors and registered users. Personal information may include: your name, email, or other information that 
identifies you personally. We do not require you to register to visit the Synapse website. However sections of the site and 
access to some content will be granted only to Registered users for research, statistics and training purposes.

### Awareness and Ethics Pledge

In order to register on Synapse, you must review and agree to the terms of the Synapse Awareness and Ethics Pledge. 
As you can see below, the Pledge recapitulates many of the themes included in the Terms and Conditions of Use, the 
Data Use Procedure, and Privacy Policy.

**Awareness and Ethics Pledge**

I commit myself to:

-	Act ethically and responsibly
-	Protect and respect data participant’s privacy and confidentiality
-	Abide by the principles for responsible data use and handling as described in the Synapse Governance Documents
-	Take full responsibility for my use of data, software, and other Synapse content
-	Share content only when I have the authority to do so and sharing does not violate any applicable laws or contracts
-	Not hack Synapse
-	Abide by all applicable laws and regulations


The Synapse [Oath](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn3722562/wiki/390754){:target="_blank"} (part of the profile verification process) reinforces these principles.

### Oversight, Audits, and Adjudication

Synapse operates under a complete governance process that includes the right of audit and external reviews. Please review these governance documents carefully as you are solely responsible for your conduct on Synapse.
The Synapse Access and Compliance Team (ACT) monitors public activities on Synapse through periodic audits to assess compliance with the Synapse governance policies. For example, through these audits, the ACT verifies that public content shared on Synapse has appropriate Conditions for Use. The ACT does not monitor activities or content placed in private projects.
The ACT supports ethical use of Synapse, including adjudicating suspected unauthorized and/or unethical use of data, as well as “unsportsmanlike” behavior within the Synapse research commons. The ACT relies on the community of researchers and research participants for vigilance against unauthorized and/or unethical use of Synapse files. Additionally, we rely on the community to hold itself to the highest standard of collegial behavior. Those unable or unwilling to meet these standards may be expelled from Synapse.
You should not hesitate to get in touch with the ACT (act@synapse.org) if you have questions about Synapse governance, including the policies, ethics, or rules for data sharing on Synapse. It is your responsibility to contact the ACT if:
•	You suspect that data is improperly shared on Synapse
•	You are concerned that data shared on Synapse is improperly or incompletely de-identified
•	You suspect unauthorized use of Synapse data
**By using Synapse you consent to these Governance policies and procedures.**

### Governance Contact information

Periodically the ACT and SB-EAT will consider mechanisms to improve the data governance process.
