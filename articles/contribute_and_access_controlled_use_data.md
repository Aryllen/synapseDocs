## Contributing Data

To contribute data to Synapse you must (1) be a **Synapse Certified User** and (2) identify the specific risks and 
appropriate protections required for sharing the data, and consider any legal, ethical or regulatory reasons why the 
data may require use restrictions. 

If there are no ethical, legal or regulatory reasons to impose use restrictions, the data can be used for any lawful 
research purpose. It is important to keep in mind that any human data shared in Synapse, with or without use restrictions, 
must be de-identified according to **HIPAA standards** and all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Guidance on de-identification 
according to HIPAA rules can be found [here](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy){:target="_blank"}. 

`Conditions for Use` can be applied at the folder or file level, or on tables. We recommend grouping files that require the 
same `Conditions for Use` in a dedicated folder within your project. It is important to note that if you move a file out of a folder, 
the file will no longer be controlled by the original folder’s `Conditions for Use`. 

When creating a folder or file, the default `Conditions for Use` is **None.** You can set `Conditions for Use` by clicking on 
the **change** link using the web interface. The next dialog will ask you, "Is this sensitive human data that must be protected?" 
Answering, "Yes," will trigger an email to the Synapse Access and Compliance Team (ACT) who will contact you for instructions on 
the `Conditions for Use` that the data set requires.

## Accessing Data

Both registered and certified Synapse users can view, download, and use any data that does not have `Conditions for Use.`

### How do you access data with Conditions for Use? 

To access Controlled Use data (data with `Conditions for Use`), you must fulfill the `Conditions for Use` set by the data contributor. 

You will see the data labeled as “Controlled Use.” If you click on the Controlled Use icon, a dialog box will open that will 
guide you on how to meet the `Conditions for Use` for the data set you desire. In many cases, access requires that you read and 
agree to data-specific terms electronically in a clickwrap contract within the Synapse web interface. Occasionally, access to 
Controlled Use data requires that your analysis plan be approved by an ethics board or IRB prior to gaining access to the data set. 
You will see a dialogue box that looks like this, with specific instructions on what is required to gain access to the data:

**Controlled Use data may not be redistributed.** Each Synapse users wishing to access Controlled Use data must individually agree to the `Conditions for Use` for that data. 

### Accessing Bridge Data

Synapse houses Bridge data, data collected through research apps. This data has been donated by thousands of volunteers 
from around the world. Bridge data is only accessible to qualified researchers. To become a qualified researcher, 
a user must (1) be a certified user and (2) have an verified profile. In additional, users must agree to the `Conditions for Use` for 
your desired data set. For example, all Bridge data carries the `Condition for Use` that findings must be published as open access articles. 

**Bridge data may not be redistributed.** Each Synapse user wishing to access Bridge data must individually agree to the `Conditions for Use`.

### Flagging Inappropriate Data Use
Any human data shared in Synapse, with or without data use restrictions, must be de-identified according to HIPAA Standards and 
all applicable privacy laws and regulations. Guidance on de-identification according to HIPAA rules can be found [here](http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy){:target="_blank"}. 

**If you believe data made available in Synapse has been posted with inappropriate `Conditions for Use` contact the ACT at <mailto:act@sagebase.org> or 
click on the *Report Issue* flag next under the folder or file name. This will trigger an email to the ACT who will contact you for more details.**
