After uploading a file to Synapse, you may find the need to change it (you found an error or changed the code that generates the file, for example). Files uploaded to Synapse can be versioned. 

Only the File and Annotations of an Entity are include in the version. All other components of an Entity such as description, name, parent, ACL, and it's associated Wiki are not not part of the version, and will not vary from version to version.
