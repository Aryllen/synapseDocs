*Your ability to download a `File` or `Table` depends on your Synapse credentials AND fulfilling the `Conditions for Use`, if any, of the `File` or `Table`.  

## User Responsibilities
You are solely responsible for your actions on Synapse. You are required to abide by the [Synapse Terms and Conditions of Use]( https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SageBionetworksSynapseTermsandConditionsofUse.pdf?v=4){:target="_blank"} and all policies and principles described in the [Synapse governance documents](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2502577/wiki/65109). We strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with these documents. Please contact the Synapse Access and Compliance Team (act@synapse.org) if you have any questions.

## About Creating, Updating, and Deleting Synapse Accounts
Anyone over the age of 13 may create a Synapse account. From your Synapse profile homepage, you can edit your profile information, update your email account, and change your password. 
All user activity on Synapse is recorded for auditing purposes. So, although they can be updated, Synapse accounts cannot be deleted. All of your public activities are and will remain publically viewable. All of your activities within private projects are and will remain viewable to the people within that project. 

## Anonymous Users
Anyone can browse Synapse anonymously to review the platform features and resources, including the catalog of public `Projects`, `Files`, and `Tables`. However, `Anonymous Users` cannot create `Projects` in Synapse, add `Wiki` content, comment in a `Discussion Forums`, nor can they upload or download `Files` or `Tables`. 

## Registered Users
`Registered Users` can create `Projects` and `Wikis`. They can collaborate with other `Registered Users` and create teams. `Registered Users` can download `Open Data` and, if they fulfill `Conditions for Use`,  `Controlled Data`. <a href="https://www.synapse.org/register" class="btn btn-primary">Register</a>

## Certified Users
`Certified Users` are authorized to use the full Synapse functionality. In order to ensure that users wishing to interact more freely within Synapse are familiar with the [Synapse Commons Data Use Procedure](https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SynapseCommonsDataUseProcedure.pdf?v=4), **users must pass a short quiz (15 questions, approximately 20 minutes) to become `Certified`.**

## Qualified researchers
A `Qualified Researcher` is a Synapse `Certified User` with a _**validated user profile**_.  Synapse `Qualified Researchers` are eligible to request access to Bridge data (data collected in research studies conducted via self-guided mobile applications.)
