# Synapse Documentation

This is a documentation site for [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org). Synapse is an open source software platform that data
scientists use to carry out, track, and communicate their research in real time.

## Contributing Guide

- Assign GitHub issue to yourself to track work in progress and prevent duplicate efforts. If you don't know what you should work on, look for things tagged with `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue`.
- Create a [feature branch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) from the `gh-pages` branch to make your changes or new contribution.
- Use a Markdown editor (e.g. Typora) to visualize edits locally. 
- Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) against the `gh-pages` branch and [request a review](https://help.github.com/en/articles/requesting-a-pull-request-review).
- Merge requires approving review by product manager or ....

Synapse Docs is generated using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Follow the standard [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) guide.

Internal development can be performed by branching from `gh-pages` to your own feature branch, making changes, pushing the branch to this repository, and opening a pull request. Pull requests against the `gh-pages` branch require a review before merging.

### Creating a page

To create a page using the article layout, start by specifying at the very beginning the title, layout, excerpt, and category in the YAML front matter. The title and excerpt will show up in the article's user guide thumbnail and the category tag will be used to sort the article into its corresponding user guide tab. If no category is specified, it will default into the "How-To" tab. 

**category options:** `intro, howto, governance, dream, inpractice`


Note that the front matter needs to be enclosed between three dashed lines to work properly.

```
---
title: Name of page here
layout: article
excerpt: A blurb about this page that will show up as a description in the user guide.
category: intro 
---
```

### Style Guide 

- Page header matches the page name as stated in the [index](http://sage-bionetworks.github.io/synapseDocs/articles/) (e.g. not "Overview").
  - Article content should begin with a short summary describing what the page is about.
- Synapse entity types or features are only emphasized in the top-most Overview section on each page. e.g. `File` , `Project` 
  - In all subsequent sections, these entity types or features are referred to as proper nouns and capitalized. e.g. File, Project

### Using alert tags

There are four types of alert highlighting to inform users: note, tip, warning, and important. You can insert an alert by using any of the following code in a markdown file.
```
{% include note.html content="This is a note." %}

{% include tip.html content="This is a tip." %}
```
To include new paragraphs, just add the `<br/>` tag within the content, like this:
```
{% include warning.html content="This is a warning. `<br/>` This is the second line of the warning." %}

{% include important.html content="This is for an important message." %}
```

### Adding a table
To add a table, use Liquid to call on the markdown-table css class. Then use the standard markdown table format.
```
{:.markdown-table}
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| --- | --- |
| content | content |
| content | content |
```

### Inserting an image
Images can be inserted using either Markdown or HTML, it all depends on your preference. The examples below will display the same thing:
```
![alt text](/assets/images/image1.jpg)
<img src="/assets/images/image1.jpg" alt="alt text">
```
