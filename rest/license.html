							<p>Freelancers and web agencies cannot always conform to the terms of use of the Creative Commons license, as customers seldom desire copyright notices of third party projects on their sites.</p>
							<p>In order to make the use of YAML possible in these cases,  license models for commercial use have been developed, alternative to the Creative Commons license.</p>

YAML is strictly delivered with a visible as  well as a non-visible copyright notice.</p>
								<p>b) <strong>The subject matter of this  agreement</strong> is the granting of usage rights to the  software library &quot;<em>Yet Another  Multicolumn Layout</em>&quot; (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Software Library</strong>) in accordance with  the following terms of license. All other usage and intellectual property  rights shall remain with the Licensor. The Licensor shall not be obligated to  provide other services, particularly customer service.								</p>
								<p>c) The Licensor is Dirk Jesse, the developer and creator of the YAML  CSS Framework (hereinafter referred to as the <strong>Licensor</strong>). The licensee may be any natural or legal person  (hereinafter referred to as the<strong> Licensee</strong>).</p>
								<p>d) The term <strong>Product </strong>shall mean all work products  that the Licensee has created within the scope of this license using the YAML  software library, including but not limited to templates or webpages under one  or multiple domains.</p>
								<h6>2. Usage  Rights, Scope of License</h6>
								<p>a) The Licensor hereby grants the  Licensee a non-exclusive, worldwide right of usage (license) for the use,  duplication, and modification of the software library as well as for the  distribution of the Products (as defined under Section 1d) that are created  with the library. The Licensee is granted a general right of use to the  software library <strong>without the requirement  that the Licensor be mentioned</strong> and<strong> without the requirement that a link be provided to the YAML homepage</strong> (URL: <a href="http://www.yaml.de">http://www.yaml.de</a>). The license is <strong>not bound to a specific project</strong>, is <strong>not time-limited</strong>,<strong> </strong>and includes the usage of future versions of the software library.</p>
								<p>b) The YAML software library may only be placed in an online download  archive – regardless of its nature – with the prior written approval of the  Licensor. </p>
								<p>c) The Licensee is entitled to grant a non-exclusive, time-unlimited  sublicense for the use of the Products created with this license. The rights  conferred by the Licensor to the Licensee under this agreement regarding the duplication  and modification of the software library <strong>may  not</strong> be transferred to third parties.</p>
								<p>d) All usage rights specified under this section shall be granted  irrevocably only once the agreed-upon license fee has been paid in full.</p>
								<h6>3. License Fees</h6>
								<p>The prices and terms of payment for the  license can be found at the YAML homepage. The published prices include VAT. All  usage rights to the software library remain with the Licensor until the  agreed-upon fees have been paid in full. Should a license fee payment be past  due, the Licensee is not entitled to use the software library. </p>
								<h6>4. Guarantee</h6>
								<p>A guarantee is solely granted for the  version of the software library provided for use by the Licensor. No guarantee  is provided for deficiencies with the software library that are attributable to  subsequent modifications made by the Licensee or by third parties, or for  Products created by the Licensee with the software library.</p>
								<p>The Licensor shall ensure the delivered  software library is free from material or legal defects. The guarantee period  is one year, and begins with the downloading of the software library or  release. A one-year guarantee is also provided following Licensor repair of any  defects. If the Licensee is a company, then it is subject to the general  acceptance review obligations set forth under §377 and §378 of the German  Commercial Code (HGB). Documented notification of deficiencies must be provided  in writing within 7 days of their identification. Otherwise the guarantee  extended to the company shall be void.</p>
								<p>Although the YAML software library has been  designed for a wide range of applications, it cannot cover every possible usage  scenario. The Licensor is only liable for ensuring fulfillment of the  performances promised under this agreement.<br />
								The Licensor shall be entitled to choose at  its own discretion to satisfy a guarantee claim either by repairing the  deficiencies or by delivering a non-deficient replacement. The Licensor shall  in particular be entitled to satisfy a guarantee claim by providing a new  software release or by providing a workaround for the deficiency. The Licensee  shall be obligated to assist the Licensor in its efforts to localize a  deficiency.</p>
								<p> The Licensee shall have no right to insist  that changes or feature extensions be made to the program after the passing of  risk, even if such changes or feature extensions are required due to new legal  requirements.</p>
								<h6>5. Liability </h6>
								<p>The Licensor shall be liable in accordance  with law for damages that arise due to malice or gross negligence. The Licensor  shall not be liable for slight negligence, secondary damages, loss of profits  or financial losses. The Licensor shall not be liable for any damages that the  Licensee could have prevented through reasonable measures (e.g. through program  or data backups). In the event of a breach of essential contractual  obligations, the Licensor shall only be liable for foreseeable damages which  might typically occur under this agreement, and the amount of liability shall  not exceed the license fee paid by the Licensee. This limitation or exclusion  of liability shall not apply to damages that result from injury to life, limb,  or health.</p>
								<h6>6. Right of Termination</h6>
								<p>In the event that the Licensee is  responsible for a severe breach of the software rights granted herein, the  Licensor shall be entitled to terminate this license agreement with good cause.  The Licensee may terminate this agreement at any time without the need to  furnish a reason. Following cancellation, all rights of use held by the  Licensee shall be void. <strong>Sublicenses granted by the Licensee on the basis of  this agreement to third parties shall not be affected by termination.</strong> A  refund for payments already rendered shall only be provided if the legal  requirements thereto are fulfilled.</p>
								<h6>7. Final Provisions</h6>
								<p>Any and all oral arrangements between the  parties are void. Solely the law of the Federal Republic of Germany shall  apply, under exclusion of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the  International Sale of Goods. If any of the provisions of this agreement are  found to be invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall be  unaffected thereby. If the Licensee is a business, the place of fulfillment and  sole legal venue is Berlin. However, the Licensor is also entitled to file a  claim against the Licensee at the latter&rsquo;s court of venue.							</p>
